<h1 align="center">Javascript Libraries</h1>

---

## Definition:
A JavaScript library is a library of pre-written JavaScript which allows for easier development of JavaScript-based applications, especially for AJAX and other web-centric technologies.
<br>
One must not confuse the word "library" with "framework." The difference is quite simple: javascript frameworks provide structure to your code while libraries are generic sets of tools that aid in various tasks.
